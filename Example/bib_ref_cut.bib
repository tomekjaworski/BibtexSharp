  Abstract                 = {The paper presents a comparative study concerning the utilization of the thermographic method for the tumor structures detection, in infrared and the microwaves radiometry. This noninvasively technique makes use the human body emission in accordance to Planck radiation law. The human body respects the same laws regarding electromagnetic emission as the environmental bodies, and can be considered as a grey body. The intensity of radiation depends on the temperature and the frequency (wavelength) of the electromagnetic radiation. Compared with the infrared thermography (sensitive to surface temperature), the microwave radiometry allows the detection of depth malignant structures because the microwaves has a greater wavelength and are less absorbed by the tissue traversed from the tumor to the surface. The temperature resolution of the microwave thermography is comparable with the temperature resolution of infrared thermography which is about 0,10C. The resolution is connected to the fact that the difference between the environmental temperature (250C) and the average measured body temperature (370C) is relatively small.},

  Abstract                 = {In spatial reasoning, relationships between spatial entities play a major role. In image interpretation, computer vision and structural recognition, the management of imperfect information and of imprecision constitutes a key point. This calls for the framework of fuzzy sets, which exhibits nice features to represent spatial imprecision at different levels, imprecision in knowledge and knowledge representation, and which provides powerful tools for fusion, decision-making and reasoning. In this paper, we review the main fuzzy approaches for defining spatial relationships including topological (set relationships, adjacency) and metrical relations (distances, directional relative position).

Two examples are presented, one where recognition of face features is expressed as non bijective correspondence between graphs representing regions and spatial relations, and one where anatomical expert knowledge involving spatial relationships is used to guide the recognition of brain structures. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the powerful features of mathematical morphology lies in its strong algebraic structure, that finds equivalents in set theoretical terms, fuzzy sets theory and logics. Moreover this theory is able to deal with global and structural information since several spatial relationships can be expressed in terms of morphological operations. The aim of this paper is to show that the framework of mathematical morphology allows to represent in a unified way spatial relationships in various settings: a purely quantitative one if objects are precisely defined, a semiquantitative one if objects are imprecise and represented as spatial fuzzy sets, and a qualitative one, for reasoning in a logical framework about space. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.},

The developed algorithm dedicated to the analysis of magnetic resonance studies, improves the segmentation results by introducing simultaneous analysis of different MR projections. It is applicable especially for those cases, in which the slice thickness or slice gap are relatively big, but different sequences are available. The proposed modification to the fuzzy connectedness analysis introduces new adjacency model, taking into consideration spatial conditions of two or more acquired projections. The developed adjacency model uses the spatial series connections, generated on the DICOM header base. The presented methodology is evaluated on the database of bone tumours images.},

  Abstract                 = {The graphics processing unit (GPU) continues to make in-roads as a computational accelerator for high-performance computing (HPC). However, despite its increasing popularity, mapping and optimizing GPU code remains a difficult task, it is a multi-dimensional problem that requires deep technical knowledge of GPU architecture. Although substantial literature exists on how to map and optimize GPU performance on the more mature NVIDIA CUDA architecture, the converse is true for OpenCL on an AMD GPU, such as the 1600-core AMD Radeon HD 5870 GPU. Consequently, we present and evaluate architecture-aware mapping and optimizations for the AMD GPU. The most prominent of which include (i) explicit use of registers, (ii) use of vector types, (iii) removal of branches, and (iv) use of image memory for global data. We demonstrate the efficacy of our AMD GPU mapping and optimizations by applying each in isolation as well as in concert to a large-scale, molecular modeling application called GEM. Via these AMD-specific GPU optimizations, our optimized OpenCL implementation on an AMD Radeon HD 5870 delivers more than a four-fold improvement in performance over the basic OpenCL implementation. In addition, it outperforms our optimized CUDA version on an NVIDIA GTX280 by 12%. Overall, we achieve a speedup of 371-fold over a serial but hand-tuned SSE version of our molecular modeling application, and in turn, a 46-fold speedup over an ideal scaling on an 8-core CPU.},

  Abstract                 = {Geographers use spatial reasoning extensively in large-scale spaces, i.e., spaces that cannot be seen or understood from a single point of view. Spatial reasoning differentiates several spatial relations, e.g. topological or metric relations, and is typically formalized using a Cartesian coordinate system and vector algebra. This quantitative processing of information is clearly different from the ways human draw conclusions about spatial relations. Formalized qualitative reasoning processes are shown to be a necessary part of Spatial Expert Systems and Geographical Information Systems.

Addressing a subset of the total problem, namely reasoning with cardinal directions, a completely qualitative method, without recourse to analytical procedures, is introduced and a method for its formal comparison with quantitative formula is defined. The focus is on the analysis of cardinal directions and their properties. An algebraic method is used to formalize the meaning of directions. The standard directional symbols (N, W, etc.) are supplemented with a symbol corresponding to an undetermined direction between points too close to each other which greatly increases the power of the inference rules. Two specific systems to determine and reason with cardinal directions are discussed in some detail.

From this example and some other previous work, a comprehensive set of research steps is laid out, following a mathematically based taxonomy. It includes the extension of distance and direction reasoning to extended objects and the definitions of other metric relations that characterize situations when objects are not disjointed. The conclusions compare such an approach with other concepts.},

  Abstract                 = {Most known methods for spatial reasoning translate a spatial problem into an analytical formulation in order to solve it quantitatively. This paper describes a method for formal, qualitative reasoning about distances and cardinal directions in geographic space. The problem addressed is how to deduce the distance and direction from point A to C, given the distance and direction from A to B and B to C. We use an algebraic approach, discussing the manipulation of distance and direction symbols (e.g. [`]N', [`]E', [`]S' and [`]W', or [`]Far' and [`]Close') and define two operations, composition and inverse, applied to them. After a review of other approaches, the desirable properties of deduction rules for distance and direction values are analyzed. This includes an algebraic specification of the [`]path' image schema, from which most of the properties of distance and direction manipulation follow. Specific systems for composition of distance are explored. For directions, a formalization of the well-known triangular concept of directions (here called cone-shaped directions) and an alternative projection-based concept are explored. The algebraic approach leads to the completion of distance or direction symbols with an identity element, standing for the direction or distance from a point to itself. The so completed axiom system allows deductions, at least [`]Euclidean-approximate', for any combination of input values.},

  Abstract                 = {We explore the idea of evidence accumulation (EAC) for combining the results of multiple clusterings. First, a clustering ensemble - a set of object partitions, is produced. Given a data set (n objects or patterns in d dimensions), different ways of producing data partitions are: 1) applying different clustering algorithms and 2) applying the same clustering algorithm with different values of parameters or initializations. Further, combinations of different data representations (feature spaces) and clustering algorithms can also provide a multitude of significantly different data partitionings. We propose a simple framework for extracting a consistent clustering, given the various partitions in a clustering ensemble. According to the EAC concept, each partition is viewed as an independent evidence of data organization, individual data partitions being combined, based on a voting mechanism, to generate a new n × n similarity matrix between the n patterns. The final data partition of the n patterns is obtained by applying a hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm on this matrix. We have developed a theoretical framework for the analysis of the proposed clustering combination strategy and its evaluation, based on the concept of mutual information between data partitions. Stability of the results is evaluated using bootstrapping techniques. A detailed discussion of an evidence accumulation-based clustering algorithm, using a split and merge strategy based on the k-means clustering algorithm, is presented. Experimental results of the proposed method on several synthetic and real data sets are compared with other combination strategies, and with individual clustering results produced by well-known clustering algorithms.},

suggested that "spatial inference engines" provide the basis for rather general cognitive capabilities inside
and outside the spatial domain. The role of abstraction in spatial reasoning and the advantages of
qualitative spatial knowledge over quantitative knowledge are discussed. The usefulness of spatial
representations with a low degree of abstraction is shown. An example from vision (the aquarium domain)
is used to illustrate in which ways knowledge about space may be uncertain or incomplete. Parallels are
drawn between the spatial and the temporal domains. A concrete approach for the representation of
qualitative spatial knowledge on the basis of Ôconceptual neighborhood? is suggested and some potential
application areas are mentioned.},

  Abstract                 = {Directed lines are fundamental geometric elements to represent directed linear entities. The representations of their topological relations are so different from those of simple lines that they cannot be solved exactly with normal methods. In this paper, a new model based on point-set topology is defined to represent the topological relations between directed lines and simple geometries. Through the intersections between the start-points, end-points, and interiors of the directed lines and the interiors, boundaries, and exteriors of the simple geometries, this model identifies 5 cases of topological relations between directed lines and points, 39 cases of simple lines, and 26 cases of simple polygons. Another 4 cases of simple lines and one case of simple polygons are distinguished if considering the exteriors of the directed lines. All possible cases are furthermore grouped into an exclusive and complete set containing 11 named predicts. And the conceptual neighborhood graph is set up to illustrate their relationship and similarity. This model can provide a basis for natural language description and spatial query language to present the dynamic semantics of directed lines relative to the background features.

  Abstract                 = {A generic and robust approach for the real-time detection of people and vehicles from an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is an important goal within the framework of fully autonomous UAV deployment for aerial reconnaissance and surveillance. Here we present an approach for the automatic detection of vehicles based on using multiple trained cascaded Haar classifiers with secondary confirmation in thermal imagery. Additionally we present a related approach for people detection in thermal imagery based on a similar cascaded classification technique combining additional multivariate Gaussian shape matching. The results presented show the successful detection of vehicle and people under varying conditions in both isolated rural and cluttered urban environments with minimal false positive detection. Performance of the detector is optimized to reduce the overall false positive rate by aiming at the detection of each object of interest (vehicle/person) at least once in the environment (i.e. per search patter flight path) rather than every object in each image frame. Currently the detection rate for people is ~70% and cars ~80% although the overall episodic object detection rate for each flight pattern exceeds 90%.},

The unsupervised fuzzy partition-optimal number of classes algorithm performs well in situations of large variability of cluster shapes, densities, and number of data points in each cluster.

  Abstract                 = {A fuzzy rule based cloud classification scheme is proposed to estimate the cloud cover from satellite imagery. METEOSAT-5 images are classified into three classes: cloudy, partially cloudy, and clear sky. Five features, which measure the temporal and spatial properties of visible (VIS) and infrared (IR) images of METEOSAT-5, are used for this. The proposed classifier finds out a few human understandable rules (fuzzy rules) using exploratory data analysis. A novel attribute of the system is that it analyzes the behavior of misclassifications during training (i.e., typical mistakes) to extract a few more rules which are augmented to the initial rule base to improve its performance. The scheme is tested on images other than the training image(s) and the performance is found to be quite satisfactory. A post-processing scheme is also developed, which utilizes experts' knowledge to generate additional rules to account for coastal region, sunglint areas, and snow-covered Himalayan region. This improves the performance of the system further. Finally, the classification results are compared with multispectral threshold tests, surface synoptic observations, and total cloud cover (tcdc) of reanalysis data produced by National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). The high accuracy achieved by the proposed method may be attributed to (1) better design philosophy of classifiers; (2) good choice for the feature vectors; (3) accurate labeling of training data; and (4) exploitation of experts' knowledge. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

  Abstract                 = {Automated scene description is a very important part of, but also a very hard task in, high-level computer vision. Today, scene description is being applied in real problems such as robotic navigation. In this paper, we present a fuzzy rule-based approach that accomplishes the task of automated linguistic scene description. Membership functions for spatial relations between different components in the scene are evaluated, guided by a spatial relationship matrix that describes typical scene entities for which these relative locations are desirable. A fuzzy logic rule-based system is developed to combine the spatial relationships and other important scene properties to generate the final linguistic interpretation. Excellent results from several image examples of different types show the applicability of this approach.},

  Abstract                 = {The transient temperature response during resistance spot welding was measured as a function of various process parameters. The variables include the electrode face thickness, coolant flow rate, welding schedule, electrode force and type of zinc coating. Two different experimental methods were used. The first one used an infrared emission monitoring method which measures the surface temperature using a Thermovision system. The other method used high-speed cinematography of a cross-sectioned welding setup. The cross-sectioned surface was painted with thermosensitive paint in order to measure the movement of the isotherm during the welding process. It was found that the slowest step of heat transfer during the axial direction in resistance spot welding is convective heat transfer to the coolant at the electrode/coolant interface. There exists a critical electrode face thickness for which the minimum electrode temperature can be obtained. The critical electrode thickness changes with weld parameters such as welding current, welding time and the heat transfer coefficient at the water cooling surface.},

  Abstract                 = {Fuzzy clustering offers various possibilities for learning fuzzy if--then rules from data for classification tasks as well as for function approximation problems like in fuzzy control. In this paper we review approaches for deriving rules from data by fuzzy clustering and discuss some of their common problems. As a consequence, we propose a new method which is specifically tailored for the task of learning rules. Keywords. Fuzzy clustering, rule extraction, fuzzy control, fuzzy classification 1 Introduction The development of fuzzy control was initiated in the early 70's by the idea to construct a controller based on the empirical knowledge of an operator or control engineer. Deriving control rules from data is an alternative approach, which became ever more interesting during the last years since it does not require the difficult knowledge acquisition task from scratch. There are of course a number of approaches to learning fuzzy rules from data based for instance on techniques of learing rules.},

Such a nest is determined by its max projections on any two of its 'sides'. The area (perimeter) of T is a weighted sum of the areas (perimeters) of the T<sub>i</sub>'s. The side lengths and altitudes of T can also be defined as weighted sums obtained from projections; using these definitions, the perimeter of T is the sum of the side lengths, and the side lengths are related to the vertex angles by the Law of Sines, but there is no simple relationship between the area of T and the products of the side lengths and altitudes.},

  Abstract                 = {Temperature distribution of paper under tearing process was measured by infrared thermography. Tearing was performed by tensile tester and was able to simulate the Elmendorf tearing test. Infrared thermography successfully allowed the successive and detailed observation of heat generation around the crack tip. The stressed zone, which appears as high temperature zone, is larger in softwood pulp sheets than in hardwood pulp sheets. With the increase in beating level, both the maximum temperature-rise and the area of high temperature zone change in the same way as tear strength. They increase monotonously in the case of hardwood pulp sheet, while they decrease after passing an early peak in the case of softwood pulp sheet. The decrease in the area refers to an enhanced stress concentration. The increase in the maximum temperature rise caused by lightly beating refers to a large amount of work consumed at the crack tip. It also includes the work for fiber pulling-out.},

  Abstract                 = {The power of spatial queries for analysis and planning purposes in many different application fields has drawn significant attention within the GIS research field. The extraction of meaningful information from spatial data requires specialized data structures, query languages and query processing strategies. This paper is primarily concerned with the binary data structures that support the fuzzy queries of spatial relationships in two dimensions. For implementation purpose, the topological relations in this model are refined from a previously defined model. This modified binary spatial model will reduce the burden of geometric computation. Based on the modified binary spatial model, a CLIPS implementation for querying binary spatial relationships is investigated. Details about the query processing strategies are also provided.},

  Abstract                 = {Considering the characteristics of the inconspicuous difference between targets and backgrounds and the low contrast in infrared images, an adaptive clustering algorithm based on fuzzy particle swarm optimization is used in the infrared image processing. Fuzzy C-mean (FCM) clustering algorithm is a local search algorithm because it is easily trapped local optimum and is sensitive to initial value effectively. On the other hand, particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is a global optimization algorithm. By incorporating the local search ability of FCM algorithm and the global optimization ability of PSO and taking the clustering criterion function of FCM as the object function of PSO, a new hybrid image clustering algorithm based on particle swarm optimization and fuzzy C-mean algorithm is proposed. Experiments show that the new algorithm can get the optimal threshold by the maximum entropy.},
