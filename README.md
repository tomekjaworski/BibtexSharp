# BibtexSharp
A simple replacement for Bibtex utility written in .NET

# Goal
I've developed this simple application as an editorial tool for my PHD thesis.
Its goal is to easily customize the final look of citations in the References
chapter. So you *should not* consider it as a final or working product.
It helped me so I hope that, after minor adjustments, it will help you also :)

# Reason
Have you ever tried to do your own template by modifying any .bst file? No?
Try. The Understanding will be revealed to you :)

# Usage
I've used C# so any .NET-ish platform (like Mono) should suffice to run this.
